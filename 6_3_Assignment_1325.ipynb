        "<h3><b>While Loop:</b></h3>\n",
        "The while loop executes as long as the condition i <= 10 remains true. A counter variable is initialized before the loop and incremented during each iteration.

        "The BankAccount class represents a simple model of a bank account. It contains attributes such as account_holder and balance, along with methods to perform common banking operations like depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Constructor (__init__):</h3>\n",
        "The constructor initializes the account holder’s name and sets the initial balance. A default balance of zero is provided so that an account can be created even if no initial deposit is made.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Deposit Method:</h3>\n",
        "The deposit() method adds money to the account only if the entered amount is positive. This validation prevents incorrect transactions and ensures that the balance remains accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Withdraw Method:</h3>\n",
        "The withdraw() method checks two conditions before processing the transaction:\n",
        "\n",
        "The withdrawal amount must be greater than zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "The account must have sufficient funds.\n",
        "If both conditions are satisfied, the specified amount is deducted from the balance; otherwise, an appropriate message is displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Check Balance Method:</h3>\n",
        "The check_balance() method simply prints the current balance, allowing the user to track account activity after each transaction."
